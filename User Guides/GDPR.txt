There is a php file that can be ran on the server to deal with old ePetitions.
dailycheckexpired.php will look for signatures for ePetitions that have expired and anonymise the detail.
My idea was to run this as a scheduled task once a week...

There is also another file that could be ran daily - which was to remind the owner of the ePetitions system that there were ePetitions that were expiring.
To remind them to check if they had met minimum threshold to go to cabinet etc.
In which case the ePetition could be printed off.
